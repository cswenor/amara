## What she covers

- **Communications** — monitors inbound messages, surfaces what's urgent, drafts replies
- **Tasks & projects** — captures work, delegates to specialist agents, tracks everything to completion, follows up
- **Calendar & scheduling** — meeting requests, reminders, time management
- **Information & research** — surfaces what you need to know when you need to know it

## Status

Early days. The architecture is clear; the building is underway. See the [roadmap](./VISION.md#roadmap) for what's next.

---

## Why it's public

Built for personal use. Sharing it because there's no reason others can't run the same thing.
